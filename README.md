`$ export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/fnm:$PATH"`

With the version manager successfully installed, let's proceed to install the specific Node version for this course.  
`$ fnm install --lts`

This command will install the lates long term support version of Node.  
The version used for this course is v18.16.0

To verify that Node is installed and check its version, use the following command:

### .nvmrc File

1. Open a text editor in the root of your project directory.
2. Create a new file and save it as .nvmrc (including the leading dot).
3. In the .nvmrc file, specify the Node version you want to use for your project. You can find the desired version by visiting the official Node.js website and looking for the Long-Term Stable (LTS) or the latest version. For example, you can simply write v18.16.0 in the .nvmrc file.
4. Save the .nvmrc file and close the text editor.

Once you have created the .nvmrc file with the desired Node version, you can use the following command to install and set that specific Node version for your project:

`$ fnm use --version-file-strategy local`
